# Math Functions Explained for 5-Year-Olds

## Addition (The Sum Function)

Adding is like putting things together! 

If you have 2 cookies and your friend gives you 3 more cookies, how many cookies do you have now? You count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! You have 5 cookies. That's adding!

```
2 + 3 = 5
```

## Subtraction (The Subtract Function)

Subtraction is like taking things away.

If you have 5 stickers and you give 2 stickers to your friend, how many stickers do you have left? You started with 5, and now you have: 3 stickers left. That's subtracting!

```
5 - 2 = 3
```

## Multiplication (The Multiply Function)

Multiplication is like adding the same number over and over.

If you have 3 bags with 4 candies in each bag, how many candies do you have in total? You count: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. That's multiplying!

```
3 * 4 = 12
```

## Division (The Divide Function)

Division is like sharing things equally.

If you have 8 cupcakes and you want to share them equally with your 4 friends (including yourself), how many cupcakes does each person get? Everyone gets 2 cupcakes. That's dividing!

```
8 / 4 = 2
```

## Power (The Power Function)

Power is like multiplying a number by itself many times.

If we say "2 to the power of 3", it means 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.

It's like having 2 cupcakes, then doubling to 4 cupcakes, then doubling again to 8 cupcakes. That's 2 to the power of 3!

```
2 ^ 3 = 8
```

Or if we say "5 to the power of 2", it means 5 × 5 = 25.

It's like having 5 stickers in each of your 5 pockets. That's 5 to the power of 2!

```
5 ^ 2 = 25
```
